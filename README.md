# Identify-Customer-Segments-using-Unsupervised-Learning

This project aims to identify most important features associated with customers of a company by applying unsupervised learning to a dataset of general population and a dataset of company's customers.  First, a data pipeline is created via data cleaning, encoding, and normalization. Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and K-Means clustering are applied to general population dataset. Similarly, PCA and K-Means clustering are applied on customer dataset to identify prominent clusters. The prominent clusters are used to identify most important features associated with customers of the company.
